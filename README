	Bizzas CPU

		Main blocks:	16-bit Address bus
				 8-bit Data bus

				8-bit ALU capable of doing CMP, ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, XOR, AND, OR
				Four general purpose registers: A, B, C, D
				Non-user registers: IROP, INPC, IMMA
				Flags: Carry, Zero, Sign

		Future blocks:	IO, interrupts
				Memory buffer
				Instruction cache

				Using idle memory-bus cycles for a second core (?)


	Hobbyist CPU design

		Primarily for Quartus (II)/Block diagrams & Schematics for the visual
		(and possibly more educational) style.

		First draft in VHDL

		Initial goal is to get the CPU working on an FPGA.
