	Bizzas CPU

		Main blocks:	16-bit Program counter
				16-bit Address bus
				8-bit Data bus
				Two 8-bit ALU busses (for source A and source B)
				Instruction Loader (for 8, 16 and 24 bit instructions)
				Instruction Executor (runs the instruction once it is loaded)
				8-bit ALU capable of doing ADD, SUB, XOR, AND, OR, CMP
				Four general purpose registers: A, B, C, D
				Non-user registers: IROP, IRA, IRB

		Future blocks:	IO, interrupts
				Memory buffer
				Instruction cache
				Register renaming

				Using idle memory-bus cycles for a second core (?)


	Design process for (Instruction executor)

		* Determine control signals required
		* For each control signal, describe in text the logic for determining
		  wether the signal should be high (active) or low (default/inactive),
		  based on the contents of IROP
		* Build that logic in Quartus

	Hobbyist CPU design

		Primarily for Quartus (II)/Block diagrams & Schematics for the visual
		(and possibly more educational) style.

		Initial goal is to get the CPU working on an FPGA.
