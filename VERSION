2018-04-05		Revision 1: A quartus learning experience

2018-12-28		Revision 2: Some opcodes executing

2020-09-08		Revision 3: First opcode executing
			Simple MOV, SUB, ADD, XOR, OR opcodes working

2020-09-09		Flags implemented in ALU unit.
			JMP, JNC, JC, JNZ, JZ, JNS, JS REL8/IMM16 working

2020-09-10		Introduced Gatekeeper unit
			Implemented LD [IMM16], DST (Memory reads) and ST SRC, [IMM16] (Memory writes)

2020-09-11		Merged Gatekeeper into Regbank
			Implemented LD [C:D], A/B and ST A/B, [C:D]

2021-03-28		Compiles into 290 Logic Elements (*)

2021-04-16		Moved XOR opcode from 13 to 15 since its an exception from IMM8 opcodes.
			Compiles into 272 Logic Elements (*)

2021-05-01		Added reset delay in control unit.
			Changes to simulate with Altera ModelSim instead of builtin simulator.
			Compiles into 286 Logic Elements (*)

2021-05-07		Simplified/optimised controlunit logic
			ALU_Cin controlunit logic default value simplification
			Included Quartus project files
			Compiles into 267 Logic Elements (*)

2021-05-25		Reshuffling ALU instructions to simplify decoding
			Added instructions for INC and DEC
			Changed ZERO constant to ONE constant
			Introduced LD [imm8:reg] instruction but removed [C:D] addressing
			Introduced Shift instructions (SHR, SHL, RCR, RCL)
			Added c3 machine cycle to distinguish next IROP loading
			Compiles into 313 Logic Elements (*)

2021-05-29		Regbank DstSel logic reduction
			Compiles into 290 Logic Elements (*)

2021-05-31		Added time analysis constraints file.

2021-06-04		Verified the design on FPGA hardware (Terasic DE10-Nano)
			1st test successful @ 12.5MHz running a small test program.

(*) Including debug outputs and simpleram
    on Quartus II 13.0.1 64-bit Web Edition,
    device target Cyclone II - EP2C8T144C6

    For comparison:
    MiSTer MOS6510 implementation compiles to 1,144 Logic Elements
    on Quartus II and target device Cyclone II - EP2C8T144C6.
