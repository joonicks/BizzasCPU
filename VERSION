2018-04-05		Revision 1: A quartus learning experience

2018-12-28		Revision 2: Some opcodes executing

2020-09-08		Revision 3: First opcode executing
			Simple MOV, SUB, ADD, XOR, OR opcodes working

2020-09-09		Flags implemented in ALU unit.
			JMP, JNC, JC, JNZ, JZ, JNS, JS REL8/IMM16 working

2020-09-10		Introduced Gatekeeper unit
			Implemented LD [IMM16], DST (Memory reads) and ST SRC, [IMM16] (Memory writes)

2020-09-11		Merged Gatekeeper into Regbank
			Implemented LD [C:D], A/B and ST A/B, [C:D]

2021-03-28		Compiles into 290 Logic Elements (*)

2021-04-16		Moved XOR opcode from 13 to 15 since its an exception from IMM8 opcodes.
